# chadproject
Group project for the /sig/ discord channel programming group!

## Getting started
Clone the repo.  `$ git clone "https://github.com/matoro/chadproject"`

Install the SDL library if you haven't yet.  On deb-based distros: `$ sudo apt install libsdl2 libsdl2-dev libsdl2-mixer libsdl2-mixer-dev`

Since the included header is C++, use `g++` to compile instead.

Example:	g++ file.c -o outputfile.c -lSDL2 -lSDL2_mixer
		(Library links after src&output files)
