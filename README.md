# chadproject
Group project for the /sig/ discord channel programming group!

## Getting started
Clone the repo.  `$ git clone "https://github.com/matoro/chadproject"`
Install the SDL library if you haven't yet.  On deb-based distros: `$ sudo apt install libsdl2 libsdl2-dev libsdl2-mixer libsdl2-mixer-dev`
Since the included header is C++, use `g++` to compile instead.
